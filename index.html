      Interacting with Permissions for Powerful Features
    </h2>
    <section id="abstract">
      <p>
        This specification defines common infrastructure that other specifications can use to
        interact with browser permissions. These permissions represent a user's choice to allow or
        deny access to "powerful features" of the platform. For developers, the specification
        standardizes an API to query the permission state of a powerful feature, and be notified if
        a permission to use a powerful feature changes state.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Specifications can define features that are explicitly identified as a [=powerful
        feature=]. These features are said to be "powerful" in that they can have significant
        privacy, security, and performance implications. As such, users rely on user agents to deny
        sites the ability to use these features until they have given express permission, and
        usually only granting this ability for a limited amount of time. Express permission to
        allow a site to use a powerful feature is generally given and controlled through browser
        UI, as illustrated below.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        In this sense, a permission represents the current state of user consent for certain types
        of features, and particularly "powerful features". Ultimately the user retains control of
        these permissions and have the ability to manually grant or deny permissions through user
        preferences. Further, user agents assist users in managing permissions by, for example,
        hiding and automatically denying certain permission prompts that would otherwise be a
        nuisance, and automatically expiring granted permissions if a user doesn't visit a website
        for some time.

      <p>
        This example uses the Permissions API to decide whether local news should be shown using
        the Geolocation API or with a button offering to add the feature.

            showLocalNewsWithGeolocation();

          case "prompt":
            showButtonToEnableLocalNews();
            break;
          case "denied":
            showNationalNews();
            break;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        This example simultaneously checks the state of the `"geolocation"` and `"notifications"`

        Model

      <p>
        This section specifies a model for [=permissions=] to use [=powerful features=] on the Web
        platform.

          Permissions
        </h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn class="export">permission</dfn> represents a user's decision to allow a web
          application to use a [=powerful feature=]. This decision is represented as a permission
          [=permission/state=].
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn class="export">Express permission</dfn> refers to the user
          [=permission/grants|granting=] the web application the ability to use a [=powerful
          feature=].
        </p>
        <aside class="note" title="Limitations and extensibility">
          <p>
            Current Web APIs have different ways to deal with permissions. For example, the
            [[[notifications]]] allows developers to request a permission and check the permission
            status explicitly. Others expose the status to web pages only when they try to use the
            API, e.g., the [[[Geolocation]]] which fails if the permission was not granted without
            allowing the developer to check beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution described in this document is meant to be extensible, but isn't expected
            to be applicable to all the current and future permissions available in the web
            platform. Working Groups that are creating specifications whose permission model
            doesn't fit in the model described in this document should contact the editors by
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues">filing an issue</a>.

        </aside>
        <p>
          Conceptually, a [=permission=] for a [=powerful feature=] can be in one of the following

            The user has not given [=express permission=] to use the feature (i.e., it's the same
            as [=permission/denied=]). It also means that if a caller attempts to use the feature,
            the [=user agent=] will either be prompting the user for permission or access to the
            feature will be [=permission/denied=].
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn class="export" data-local-lt="grant" data-dfn-for="permission">Granted</dfn>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The user, or the user agent on the user's behalf, has given [=express permission=] to
            use a [=powerful feature=]. The caller will can use the feature possibly without having
            the [=user agent=] asking the user's permission.

            <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for="permission">Denied</dfn>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The user, or the user agent on the user's behalf, has denied access to this [=powerful
            feature=]. The caller will can't use the feature.
          </dd>

        <p>
          To ascertain <dfn class="export">new information about the user's intent</dfn>, a user
          agent MAY collect and interpret information about a user's intentions. This information
          can come from explicit user action, aggregate behavior of both the relevant user and
          other users, or <dfn>implicit signals</dfn> this specification hasn't anticipated.
        </p>
        <aside class="note" data-cite="appmanifest" title="What constitutes an implicit signal?">
          <p>
            The <a>implicit signals</a> could be, for example, the [=installed web
            application|installation=] status of a web application or frequency and recency of
            visits. A user that has installed a web application and used it frequently and recently
            is more likely to trust it. Implementations are advised to exercise caution when
            relying on implicit signals.

        <p data-cite="ECMAScript">
          Every [=permission=] has a <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for="permission">lifetime</dfn>,

          before it reverts back to its [=permission/default state=]. A [=permission/lifetime=]
          could be until a particular [=ECMAScript/Realm=] is destroyed, until a particular
          [=top-level browsing context=] is destroyed, a particular amount of time, or be infinite.
          The lifetime is negotiated between the end-user and the [=user agent=] when the user
          gives [=express permission=] to use a [=feature=]—usually via some permission UI or
          user-agent defined policy.

        <p>
          Every permission has a <dfn data-for="permission">default state</dfn> (usually
          [=permission/prompt=]), which is the [=permission/state=] that the permission is in when
          the user has not yet given [=express permission=] to use the [=feature=] or it has been

            Specifications that define one or more [=powerful features=] SHOULD suggest a

            Some guidance on determining the lifetime of a permission is noted below, with a strong
            emphasis on user privacy. If no [=permission/lifetime=] is specified, the user agent
            provides one.

          <ol>
            <li>Set the permission back to its default [=permission state=] (e.g., by setting it
            back to "[=permission/prompt=]").
            </li>
            <li>For each |browsing context| associated with the origin (if any), [=queue a global

            object=] to run the [=powerful feature/permission revocation algorithm=].
            </li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="note" title="Determining the lifetime of a permission">
            <p>
              For particularly privacy-sensitive [=features=], such as [[[GETUSERMEDIA]]], which
              can provide a web application access to a user's camera and microphone, some user
              agents expire a permission [=permission/grant=] as soon as a browser tab is closed or
              [=navigated=]. For other features, like the [[[Geolocation]]], user agents are known
              to offer a choice of only granting the permission for the session, or for one day.
              Others, like the [[[Notifications]]] and [[[push-api]]] APIs, remember a user's
              decision indefinitely or until the user manually revokes the permission. Note that
              permission [=permission/lifetimes=] can vary significantly between user agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finding the right balance for the lifetime of a permission requires a lot of thought
              and experimentation, and often evolves over a period of years. Implementers are
              encouraged to work with their UX security teams to find the right balance between
              ease of access to a [=powerful feature=] (i.e., reducing the number of permission
              prompts), respecting a user's privacy, and making users aware when a web application
              is making use of a particular powerful feature (e.g., via some visual or auditory UI
              indicator).

        Relationship to the Permissions Policy specification
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although both this specification and the [[[Permissions-Policy]]] specification deal with
        "permissions", each specification serves a distinct purpose in the platform. Nevertheless,
        the two specifications do explicitly overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, this specification exclusively concerns itself with [=powerful features=]
        whose access is managed through a user-agent mediated permissions UI (i.e., permissions
        where the user gives express consent before that feature can be used, and where the user
        retains the ability to deny that permission at any time for any reason). These powerful
        features are registered in the [[[permissions-registry]]].
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the [[[Permissions-Policy]]] specification allows developers to
        selectively enable and disable policy-controlled features through a "[=Document/permissions
        policy=]" (be it a HTTP header or the [^iframe/allow^] attribute). In that sense, the
        Permissions Policy subsumes this specification in that [[[Permissions-Policy]]] governs
        whether a feature is available at all, independently of this specification. These
        policy-controlled features are also registered in the [[[permissions-registry]]].
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful feature that has been disabled by the [[[Permissions-Policy]]] specification
        always has its [=permission state=] reflected as "denied" by this specification. This
        occurs because [=getting the current permission state|reading the current permission=]
        relies on [[HTML]]'s "[=allowed to use=]" check, which itself calls into the
        [[[Permissions-Policy]]] specification. Important to note here is the sharing of permission
        names across both specifications. Both this specification and the [[[Permissions-Policy]]]
        specification rely on other specifications defining the names of the permission and
        [=powerful feature/name=], and they are usually named the same thing (e.g., "geolocation"
        of the [[[Geolocation]]], and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it's not possible for a powerful feature to ever become "granted" through any
        means provided by the [[[Permissions-Policy]]] specification. The only way that a
        [=powerful feature=] can be [=permission/granted=] is by the user giving [=express
        permission=] or by some user agent policy.

        Privacy considerations

      <p>
        An adversary could use a <a>permission state</a> as an element in creating a "fingerprint"
        corresponding to an end-user. Although an adversary can already determine the state of a
        permission by actually using the API, that often leads to a UI prompt being presented to
        the end-user (if the permission was not already [=permission/granted=]). Even though this
        API doesn't expose new fingerprinting information to websites, it makes it easier for an
        adversary to have discreet access to this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent SHOULD provide a means for the user to review, update, and reset the
        [=permission=] [=permission/state=] of [=powerful features=] associated with an [=origin=].
