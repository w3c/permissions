    <section id="abstract">
      <p>
        The <cite>Permissions API</cite> specification defines common infrastructure that other
        specifications can use to interact with browser permissions that allow or deny access to
        powerful features on the web platform. For developers, the specification defines an API to
        query the permission state of a powerful feature, or be notified if a permission for a
        powerful feature changes state.

        This is a work in progress.

      <p>
        Some features in this specification are supported by only one user agent, and as such, are

      <p>
        This example uses the Permissions API to decide whether local news should be shown using
        the Geolocation API or with a button offering to add the feature.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js" title="Using .state attribute">
        const { state } = await navigator.permissions.query({

            break;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        This example is checking whether the page has the {{PermissionName/"geolocation"}} and the

        This section specifies a model for [=permissions=] to use [=powerful features=] on the Web

          Permissions
        </h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn class="export">permission</dfn> represents a user's decision to allow a web
          application to access a [=powerful feature=].
        </p>
        <aside class="note" title="Limitations">
          <p>
            Current Web APIs have different ways to deal with permissions. For example, the
            [[notifications]] API allows developers to request a permission and check the
            permission status explicitly. Others expose the status to web pages when they try to
            use the API, like the [[Geolocation]] which fails if the permission was not granted
            without allowing the developer to check beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution described in this document is meant to be extensible, but isn't expected
            to be applicable to all the current and future permissions available in the web
            platform. Working Groups that are creating specifications whose permission model
            doesn't fit in the model described in this document should contact the editors by
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues">filing an issue</a>.

          Conceptually, a [=permission=] can be in one of the following <dfn data-dfn-for=

            <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for="permission">Prompt</dfn>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The prompt [=permission/state=] represents that the user has not made a decision (i.e.,
            it's the same a [=permission/denied=]), and the [=user agent=] will be asking the user
            for permission if the caller tries to access the feature. The user might then grant,
            deny, ignore, or dismiss the request.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn class="export" data-local-lt="grant" data-dfn-for="permission">Granted</dfn>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The granted [=permission/state=] represents that the caller will be able to
            successfully access the feature without having the [=user agent=] asking the user's
            permission.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn class="export" data-dfn-for="permission">Denied</dfn>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The denied [=permission/state=] represents that the caller will not be able to access
            the feature.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          To ascertain <dfn class="export">new information about the user's intent</dfn>, a user
          agent MAY collect information about a user's intentions. This information can come from
          explicit user action, aggregate behavior of both the relevant user and other users, or
          <dfn>implicit signals</dfn> this specification hasn't anticipated.
        </p>
        <aside class="note" data-cite="appmanifest" title="Implicit signals">
          <p>
            The <a>implicit signals</a> could be, for example, the [=installed web
            application|install=] status of a web application or frequency and recency of visits. A
            user that has installed a web application and used it frequently and recently is more
            likely to trust it. Implementations are advised to exercise caution when relying on
            implicit signals.

        <p>
          A <dfn class="export" data-local-lt="feature">powerful feature</dfn> is a web platform
          feature (usually an API) for which a user has to [=permission/grant=] [=permission=]
          before the feature can be used. Access to the feature is determined by the <a>environment
          settings object</a> by the user having [=permission/granted=] permission via UI, or by
          satisfying some criteria that is equivalent to a permission [=permission/grant=].

        <p>
          A [=powerful feature=] is identified by its <dfn data-dfn-for=

          The user agent is responsible for tracking what <a>powerful features</a> each [=global

          operations defined in this section to retrieve the UA's notion of what permissions are
          granted or denied, and to ask the user to grant or deny more permissions.

            <p>
              If the descriptor does not have a {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}}, its
              semantic is that it queries for access to all devices of that class. Thus, if a query
              for the {{PermissionName/"camera"}} permission with no
              {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} returns {{PermissionState/"granted"}}, the
              client knows that there will never be a permission prompt for a camera, and if
              {{PermissionState/"denied"}} is returned, it knows that no getUserMedia request for a
              camera will succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a permission state is present for access to some, but not all, cameras, a query

            <p>
              Note that a "granted" permission is no guarantee that getUserMedia will succeed. It
              only guarantees that the user will not be prompted for permission. There are many
              other things (such as constraints or the camera being in use) that can cause
              getUserMedia to fail.

        Relationship to the Permissions Policy specification
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although technically this specification and the Permissions Policy specification
        ([[Permissions-Policy]]) deal with "permissions", each specification serves a distinct
        purpose in the platform. Nevertheless, the two specifications do explicitly overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, this specification exclusively concerns itself with [=powerful features=]
        whose access is managed through a user-agent mediated permissions UI (i.e., permissions
        where the user gives express consent before that feature can be used, and where the user
        retains the ability to deny that permission at any time for any reason). These powerful
        features are explicitly identified by this specification's {{PermissionName}} enum.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the Permissions Policy specification allows developers to selectively
        enable and disable [=powerful features=] through a "[=Document/permissions policy=]" (be it
        a HTTP header or a the [^iframe/allow^] attribute). The APIs and features in scope for the
        Permissions Policy specification go beyond those identified in this specification's
        {{PermissionName}} enum (e.g., "sync-xhr" and "gamepad"). In that sense, the Permissions
        Policy subsumes this specification in that Permissions Policy governs whether a feature is
        available at all, independently of this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful feature that has been disabled by the Permissions Policy specification always
        has its permission state reflected as "denied" by this specification. This occurs because
        reading the current permission state relies on [[HTML]]'s "[=allowed to use=]" check, which
        itself calls into the Permissions Policy specification. Important to note here is the
        sharing of permission names across both specifications. Where this specification has the
        {{PermissionName}} enum, the Permissions Policy specification relies on other
        specifications defining the names of the permissions (e.g., the permission "gamepad" is
        defined in [[Gamepad]], and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it's not possible for a powerful feature to ever become "granted" through any
        means provided by the Permissions Policy specification. The only way that a powerful
        feature can be "granted" is through a user-agent provided permission UI, or by some other
        user agent policy.

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        An adversary could use a <a>permission state</a> as an element in creating a "fingerprint"
        corresponding to an end-user. Although an adversary can already determine the state of a
        permission by actually using the API, that often leads to a permission request UI being
        presented to the end-user (if the permission was not already
        {{PermissionState/"granted"}}). Thus, even though this API doesn't expose new
        fingerprinting information to websites, it makes it easier for an adversary to have
        discreet access to this information. Thus, implementations are encouraged to have an option
        for users to block (globally or selectively) the querying of <a>permission states</a>.
